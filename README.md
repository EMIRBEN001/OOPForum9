1a. A class is a template for an object, and an object is a class instance. According to the preceding situation, a manager may be a class with a name and a salary. Adding a manager, together with his or her name and Salary, is an example of that class. 

1b. The Manager and sales person are office staff, those two can inherrit or extend the office staff class.
Another good example is a product class. Different types of products can inherit from the product class.

1c. Libraries greatly reduce the amount of effort required by allowing users to use existing classes and methods without having to create such classes and methods from scratch.   

2b. Accessor methods are important for the variables that are private and should not be changed freely.

2cii. since the object has an accessor method, but no mutator methods, then it can't be updated or changed in the future if needed to be.
